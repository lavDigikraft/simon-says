## Simon Says

- I started this project on 28/03/2025, thought maybe I'd go through my problem-solving, and was done with this project in 1.5 hrs (created from scratch with 0 external help, not a flex tbh for a project like this). Not a hard project tbh, but felt very new experience tbh. 

- Vanilla JS is still best. React spoiled me ofc, that's why it feels nice to finish a simple Vanilla JS project, reminds me of the Lac I knew from a year ago.

- Deploying for fun (29/03/2025)
